<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish celebrated for its rich layers of flavor and comforting texture. Traditionally, it consists of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with layers of savory fillings, such as a seasoned meat sauce (often a ragù made with beef or pork), creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and a generous topping of grated cheese like mozzarella or Parmigiano-Reggiano. The assembled dish is baked until the cheese melts and forms a golden, bubbly crust, creating a harmonious combination of tender pasta, hearty sauce, and creamy, cheesy goodness in every bite.
</p>
<p>While the traditional meat-based version is the most well-known, lasagna is highly versatile. Variations include vegetarian versions with layers of roasted vegetables, spinach, or mushrooms, and even seafood or gluten-free adaptations. Its appeal lies not only in its flavor but also in its ability to feed a crowd, making it a favorite for family meals, gatherings, and celebrations. The dish’s layers symbolize warmth and indulgence, earning lasagna a beloved spot in Italian cuisine and kitchens worldwide.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>9–12 lasagna noodles (regular or no-boil)</li>
    <li>1 lb (450 g) ground beef or ground turkey</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2–3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 can (24 oz / 680 g) crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 can (6 oz / 170 g) tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
    <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>15 oz (425 g) ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Fresh parsley or basil for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat Oven:
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Cook the Noodles:
If using regular lasagna noodles, boil them in salted water according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and lay them flat on a sheet to prevent sticking. (Skip this step if using no-boil noodles.)</li>
    <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce:

In a large skillet, sauté chopped onions and garlic in a bit of olive oil until soft.

Add the ground beef (or turkey) and cook until browned.

Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Let it simmer for 10–15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:

In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, the egg, and a pinch of salt. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Assemble the Lasagna:

Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9×13-inch baking dish.

Lay 3–4 noodles on top of the sauce.

Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.

Sprinkle 1/3 of the shredded mozzarella.

Add another layer of meat sauce.

Repeat layers (noodles → ricotta → mozzarella → sauce) until all ingredients are used. Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
    <li>Bake:
Cover the dish with aluminum foil (tent it slightly to avoid touching the cheese) and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake another 15–20 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
    <li>Rest & Serve:
Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing. This helps it hold together for perfect servings. Garnish with fresh parsley or basil if desired.</li>
