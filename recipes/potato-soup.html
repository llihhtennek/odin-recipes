<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Potato soup is a warm, comforting dish made primarily from tender potatoes simmered in a flavorful broth or creamy base. As the potatoes cook, they soften and naturally thicken the soup, creating a smooth, velvety texture. Many versions include onions, garlic, and herbs for depth of flavor, while milk or cream adds richness and a satisfying, hearty consistency.
</p>
<p>Often finished with toppings like shredded cheese, crispy bacon, green onions, or a dollop of sour cream, potato soup can be customized to suit different tastes. It’s a simple yet filling meal, especially popular during colder months, offering both nourishment and a cozy, home-cooked feel in every spoonful.
