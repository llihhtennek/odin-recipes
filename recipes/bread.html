<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bread is one of the oldest and most widely consumed foods in the world, made primarily from flour and water, often with yeast or another leavening agent. When baked, the dough transforms into a soft, airy interior with a golden, sometimes crisp crust. The fermentation process, especially in yeast-leavened breads, gives bread its characteristic rise and subtle flavor, while different grains—such as wheat, rye, or barley—create variations in texture, taste, and nutritional value.
</p>
<p>Across cultures, bread takes many forms, from crusty baguettes and hearty whole-grain loaves to flatbreads and enriched varieties made with milk, eggs, or butter. It serves as a staple food in many diets, providing carbohydrates for energy along with fiber, vitamins, and minerals, depending on the ingredients used. Simple yet versatile, bread can be enjoyed on its own, paired with spreads, or used as the foundation for countless dishes.
